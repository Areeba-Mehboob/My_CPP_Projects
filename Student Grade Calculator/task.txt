A program that implements a C++ class “Student” with following data members
•	Age
•	Roll Number
•	GPA
•	markSubject1
•	marksSubject2
•	marksSubject3
The class should define a method/function to calculate percentage from marks obtained in three subjects.
Finally, you’ll create objects of Student class, initialize their data members through set and get functions, calculate percentages, determine grades and print summary in the end.
